# The Solorice (Kristofers Solo dotfiles)

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- nsxiv (image/gif viewer)
	- mpv (video player)
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
